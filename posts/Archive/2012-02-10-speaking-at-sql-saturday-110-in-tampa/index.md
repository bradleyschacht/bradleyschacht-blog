![](https://images.bradleyschacht.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/SQL-Saturday-Tampa-110.png) I got word this week that one of my sessions for the upcoming SQL Saturday #110 in Tampa, FL was accepted.  If you are unaware, SQL Saturday is a free day of training that takes place on a Saturday.  I'm sure that didn't need any explanation, but you just never know.  So if you happen to live in the Tampa, FL area or even in Orlando or South Florida it's not too bad of a drive to see me. Yep, I know that will be the sole reason many people go to this event.  Well, all kidding aside, check out the details on my session and the event below! Hope to see you there.  No idea what time my session will be as the schedule on the site right now doesn't have that information...I'm shooting for mid-day.  :) **When:** Saturday March 10, 2012 **Time:** I assume the first session will be 8 or 8:30, the website doesn't have a good copy of the schedule at this point **Where:** K-Force, 1001 East Palm Ave, Tampa, FL, 33605 **Speaker:** Bradley Schacht **Subject Area:** SharePoint BI **Session Title:** PowerPivot and Excel Services in SharePoint 2010 **Session Description:** Excel Services is an extremely powerful tool that you can use inside your environment to help improve workflow and collaboration. Some of the topics discussed will include the service application, associating the application with your SharePoint site, data connections and the unattended service account. We will also talk about how PowerPivot for Excel translates into the SharePoint experience including setup, deployment and what happens in the background. Most of the time will be spent talking about PowerPivot and this exciting new technology.
