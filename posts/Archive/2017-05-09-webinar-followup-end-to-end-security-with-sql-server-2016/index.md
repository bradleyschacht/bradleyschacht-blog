I recently presented a free webinar for [Pragmatic Works](http://www.pragmaticworks.com/) where I discussed new security features in SQL Server 2016. You can [click here](http://pragmaticworks.com/Training/Details/End-to-End-Security-with-SQL-Server-2016) to watch the recording of the webinar if you missed it. In this follow up I wanted to post the scripts I used and link to a few resources. Here is a link to the scripts/deck from my presentation: [End to End Security with SQL Server 2016](https://images.bradleyschacht.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/End-to-End-Security-with-SQL-Server-2016.zip) Here is a link to the recording of the session (free to view): [http://pragmaticworks.com/Training/Details/End-to-End-Security-with-SQL-Server-2016](http://pragmaticworks.com/Training/Details/End-to-End-Security-with-SQL-Server-2016) I cannot take credit for the scripts and demos for everything that I used. As mentioned in the webinar a portion of the content was derived from a blog post that Jamey Johnston did and can be found here: [http://blog.jameyjohnston.com/oil-gas-sql-server-security-demo/](http://blog.jameyjohnston.com/oil-gas-sql-server-security-demo/) He did an awesome job creating a end to end demo of masking, RLS and Always Encrypted along with a pretty cool data set. My session wasn’t solely objects from his blog post but I did use some pieces and want to make sure he gets credit for the work!
