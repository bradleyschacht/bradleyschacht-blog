There could be a number of reasons why you would want to change the default view on a SharePoint library. Perhaps you created a new view and want to make it the default. Maybe you created a PowerPivot library and don't have Silverlight installed. The list could go on. Luckily setting the default view is really simple.

- Navigate to the library which you would like to change the default view on.
- From the ribbon select **Library** then click on the **Library Settings** option.

- When the library settings appear scroll down to the bottom and locate the **Views** section. This will list all views available. You can also create a new view here if you would like. Note the column called **Default View** will indicate which view is currently marked as the default.
- Click on the name of the view which you would like to be the default. In this example we will choose the **All Documents** view.

- Check the box next to **Make this the default view**.
- Click **OK**
