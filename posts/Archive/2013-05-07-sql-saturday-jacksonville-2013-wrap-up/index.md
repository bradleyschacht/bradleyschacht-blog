It was another great year at SQL Saturday Jacksonville. For the last several years I have been lucky enough to be part of the group that organizes the event. It's definitely a lot of work leading up to the event, the others on the team definitely do more work than I do, the day of the event is super crazy and I'm so happy when it is done. That being said I love being able to give back to a community that has done so much to help me advance my career. There are a lot of people outside the 7 of us that organize the event that make it happen. We had so many volunteers this year that we actually had to tell some people we didn't have any work for them. The response was amazing to say the least. Our sponsors also came through in a big way and provided plenty of funding for us to be able to put the event on and provide a fun after party for those who wanted to come hang out for a little while longer. We get speakers from all over that come to Jacksonville. No one gets paid to speak that the event or any other SQL Saturday for that matter. So next time you are at a free training day like this just give them a little thank you for taking time out of their Saturday to help out for no other reason than they enjoy giving back to the community. Finally, the event would be nothing without everyone who attends. You are the reason these events happen and the reason the SQL community is thriving. SQL Saturday was and continues to be a great resource for advancing my career and it's great to see new faces at these events and to know that people care enough to take their own time to advance their careers. Ok, on to the content.... If you were at either of my sessions I would like to extend a thank you for joining. I know there was a lot of content to be covered in both sessions and there is no way I answered every question that people had. I definitely promised to post some content from my second session (SharePoint for the DBA) that I have compiled. Attached you will find my session notes which I know we didn't get all the way through. While there isn't necessarily a lot of brand new content in there it is a compilation of information that you would have to go many different places to get. Hopefully it saves you some time instead of having to look it up yourself. If you have any questions about either session please feel free to leave me a comment and I will be sure to answer it as soon as I can! Thanks again for joining us for another wonder event!
