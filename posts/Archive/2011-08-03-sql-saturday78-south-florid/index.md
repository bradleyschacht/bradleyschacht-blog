I will be doing three sessions on Saturday: Intro to SSIS, Dynamic SSIS:Expressions, Configurations and Variables as well as co-presenting Pulp SQL with Jorge Segarra ([Blog](http://www.sqlchicken.com)|[Twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/sqlchicken)).  Below you will find the details for my sessions as well as the required information for the event.  **Please note that a parking pass is required and you can print it from the SQL Saturday site** (link below). **11:00 AM - Introduction to SSIS:** In this session Brad will help get you past the learning curve of SSIS. He will cover the basics of the development environment, the control flow and data flow. Brad will show you how to create an end to end package to demonstrate best practices and illustrate design concepts. This is a great session for anyone who is new to SSIS. **1:00 PM - Configuring and Extending SSIS:** In this session Brad will walk you through some of the best practices for configuring SSIS. Each of the configuration types will be covered from XML to registry entries. The use of expressions for configuring your SSIS package will also be covered. Finally he will walk you through some best practices for moving your packages between environments and keeping your configurations up to date. **2:15 PM - Pulp SQL (With Jorge Segarra):** Stories, all have them. In this session Brad and Jorge will tell the tales of how SQL in shops can go horribly wrong, and how to properly go about doing it. This story will be told Tarrantino-style so prepare for some twists, characters and ninja-like tactics\* to help you avoid your own SQL mistakes! \*fight scenes may or may not break out **When:** August 13, 2011 **Time:** Registration starts at 7:30 AM with first sessions at 8:30 AM **Where:** Nova Southeastern University in Davie, FL All the details can be found on the SQL Saturday [event page](https://sqlsaturday.com/) Link to the parking pass, which is **REQUIRED**: Download it here Hope to see you there!!
