If you read my [2013 Year In Review](https://bradleyschacht.com/year-in-review-2013/) you may be here today wondering why I haven't posted anything despite my stated desire to blog more over the next year. Well, it's not because I'm waiting until after the new year or anything like that....well, not that may sound a little bit like a lie given my reasoning...I've simply been on vacation for the last week and a half. I won't be back from vacation until after the first of the year at which point I will pick things up a little more. So I'm going to hit the ground running when I get back from vacation, which just happens to be after the new year kicks off. I hope everyone has had a wonderful holiday season. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you all! -Brad
