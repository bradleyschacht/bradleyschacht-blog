We are back in business!

It's been a few years since there was an in-person PASS Summit. Some major changes and a couple of years later we are excited to be back in person for what is now the "PASS Data Community Summit".

If SQL Saturday and Data Saturday event sizes are any indication, this conference will be significantly smaller than past years when it was the PASS Summit but with just as much great content and many great networking opportunities. I can't wait to make my way out to Seattle, meet some new people, and present on Synapse + Power BI.

This year I will be presenting a session called "[Better Together: Power BI and Azure Synapse Analytics](https://passdatacommunitysummit.com/sessions/all-sessions/1855)". If you have ever attended a session of mine in the past, you will know I don't like slides. This session will walk through the adventure of creating a Power BI report on Synapse serverless, eventually hitting performance challenges as the dataset gets really big, tuning the report and Synapse layers, and ultimately making the end users happy again.

If you're attending the Data Community Summit and are looking for a fun place to go at 2:30 PM, come on by! I'll also be around on Wednesday at the Microsoft booth and other places around the conference. If you have Synapse questions or just want to meet to talk, come find me!
