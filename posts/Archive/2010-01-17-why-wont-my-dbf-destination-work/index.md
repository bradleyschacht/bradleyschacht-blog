This past week I ran into an issue where I needed to use a .dbf destination in my SSIS package. All was going well; I set up the destination and pressed the preview button to make sure everything was great, and BOOM! Blew up in my face. Not cool. So if you happen to be having issues setting up a connection for a .DBF here is what you need to do. Use the **Native OLE DBMicrosoft Jet 4.0 OLE DB Provider** The protocols for connection are stored in the Extended Properties (located on the **All** tab), which is where the issue was… My connection defaulted to DBase **5.0** and **Persist Security Info=True** ![](https://images.bradleyschacht.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/DBF1.png) There are actually three different options for the DBase type that are used: 3, 4 and 5. So after a little digging I decided to try and change that to something other than 5. I changed to 4, but that didn’t work. You may need to not only change that, but remove the **Persist Security Info=True** ![](https://images.bradleyschacht.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/DBF2.png) Next on the **Connection** tab you need to select the database file name. For this be sure to **ONLY** select the folder that the .dbf is located in, not the actual file itself. ![](https://images.bradleyschacht.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/DBF3.png) Finally, in your source or destination selection the OLE DB Connection Manager and on the table or view you will have a list of all the .dbf files in that directory. Simply select the appropriate file name, and you’re good to go! ![](https://images.bradleyschacht.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/DBF4.png) Just as a note, when you enter DBase #, make sure to use roman numerals. If you want DBase 3 it must read DBase III, or DBase 4 as DBase IV. If you put in the number the connection will error out. Also, it depends on your system what DBase needs to be in the extended properties, it will not always be DBase IV.
