### Introducing Microsoft Fabric: The All-in-One Analytics Solution

The world is awash with data and it is up to data professionals to make sense of it all. Just a few weeks ago Microsoft announced the next generation of analytics at Build: Microsoft Fabric!

Fabric is a complete end-to-end analytics platform bringing together Azure Data Factory, Azure Synapse, and Power BI in a single location and more deeply integrated than ever. It’s built on a SaaS platform which helps deliver innovation more quickly and allowing users to get up and running in seconds. At the core Fabric provides a lake-centric and open data hub using the popular Delta format with built-in security, governance, and compliance throughout. At the edge, Fabric delivers flexibility for data scientists, data warehouse developers, and Power BI users to build and analyze using their unique skill sets.

During this session we will discuss the guiding principles and architecture behind Fabric and show a lot of demos! Whether you’re a data engineer, data scientist, data warehouse developer, or an existing Power BI user, Fabric has something for everyone. You won’t want to miss this session!
