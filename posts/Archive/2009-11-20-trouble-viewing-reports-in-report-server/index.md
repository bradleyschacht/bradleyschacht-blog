Run Internet Explorer as Administrator (Right Click on IE and select Run as Administrator) 2. Log into the report manager by going to localhost/reports 3. Select 'Site Settings' (Next to Home and Help in the top right corner) 4. Click on Security on the left panel 5. Select New Role Assignment 6. Add the desired user name in the text field and check the box next to System Administrator ![](https://images.bradleyschacht.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Reports2.png) Once this is completed add the report server to your trusted sites list in IE.  To do this open the Tools menu and select the security tab from Internet Options. Be sure to uncheck the box next to Enable Protected Mode for trusted sites.  IE needs to be running with Protected Mode off for this to work properly. ![](https://images.bradleyschacht.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Reports3.png) This is a combination issue of UAC and permissions settings.  If you can't make these changes in you environment, you may be stuck with having to Run as Administrator every time you want to view the report server.
