It's finally here, PASS Summit 2012. Everything kicks off tomorrow and Tuesday with a couple days of pre-cons then the regular sessions on Wednesday to Friday. I've been in Seattle since late on Friday with a handful of Pragmatic Works team members. I'm looking forward to meeting a lot of new people and having a great time! I'll likely be spending Monday doing final preparations for my sessions on Wednesday and Friday. Tuesday will bet relax and tourist day. Then Wednesday starts the craziness. Hope your ready. Are you at Summit? If so look around for me, I'd love to chat for a bit. If your on Twitter follow me @bradleyschacht and the hash tags #Summit12 and #PASSSummit to keep up with all the happenings! I'll be doing random blog posts from my phone throughout the week, so keep an eye out for cool information as it becomes available.
