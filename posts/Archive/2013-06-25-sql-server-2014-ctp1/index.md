CTP 1 of SQL Server 2014 was released this evening. If you have an MSDN or TechNet account you can go grab it now! If you are curious about some of the features here is the Microsoft page and there are plenty of blogs out there as well: [http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sqlserver/sql-server-2014.aspx](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sqlserver/) This is preview software so be sure to read up on the release notes and install on a virtual machine to ensure nothing mission critical gets messed up. Happy data exploration! ![](https://images.bradleyschacht.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/SQLServer2014CTP1.jpg)
