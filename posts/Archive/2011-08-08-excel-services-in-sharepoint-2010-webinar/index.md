![](https://images.bradleyschacht.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/image_thumb1.png)Tomorrow I will be presenting a webinar at 11 AM eastern time for the Pragmatic Works Training on the T’s.  This month each of the authors of the SharePoint 2010 Business Intelligence 24-Hour Trainer available from Wrox are presenting a topic they covered in the book.  I happened to write the chapter on setting up and deploying Excel services applications.  So tomorrow get ready for awesomeness to overtake your computer screen for an hour while I explain Excel services to you.  We will set up the web application, build a workbook and then deploy it.  This session is not made to give you all the information about Excel services, but it will give you some great insight into how to use it if you are new to SharePoint or considering upgrading to SharePoint 2010. As always the webinar is a FREE event.  Just head over to PragmaticWorks.com to register.  If you aren’t able to make it out you can always view the recording after it is done.  Here is the link to register: [https://www1.gotomeeting.com/register/159759184](https://pragmaticworks.com/ "https://www1.gotomeeting.com/register/159759184") And here are all the details of the session: Presenter: Bradley Schacht When: Tuesday, August 9, 2011 11:00 AM – 12:00 PM EDT Excel Services is an extremely powerful tool that you can use inside your environment to help improve workflow and collaboration.  In this session Brad will take you from start to finish through the process for getting your new SharePoint 2010 site ready to work with Excel Services.  Some of the topics discussed will include the service application, associating the application with your SharePoint site, data connections and the unattended service account.  Once the site is configured to work with Excel Services we will create a report inside Excel, deploy it and show some of the great features available like embedding portions of the workbook into a dashboard.  After this session you will be able to create a new Excel Services web application and use it to share workbooks in your environment.
