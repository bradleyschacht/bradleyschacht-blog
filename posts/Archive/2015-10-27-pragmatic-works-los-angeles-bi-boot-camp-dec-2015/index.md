Click to purchase a seat in the [Pragmatic Works Los Angeles BI Boot Camp](http://pragmaticworks.com/Training/Details/BI-Quick-Start-Boot-Camp). ![](https://images.bradleyschacht.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/bi-boot-camp-dec-2015.png) Microsoft has a wide range of offerings in the business intelligence space and it can take a lot of work to figure out how they all fit together. The Pragmatic Works BI Boot Camp will walk you through a week of hands on activities that show exactly how each piece of the BI stack works. I will be teaching the class for all 5 days. We will start each day around 8:30 and wrap up between 4:30 and 5:00. We have developed hands on labs to do throughout the day. So as we discuss a topic, like loading a dimension, you will have a lab to help reinforce the information we just discussed. By doing short, focused modules followed by labs, we have found students retain much more information and are better equipped to apply the new skills back in the workplace. You will also be able to take the final solution and step by step lab material with you for reference. Our goal is to leverage our experiences as consultants to provide the best possible training.

> "What sets @PragmaticWorks apart is all our trainers bring real world experience to class."

The week starts with the basics of building a dimensional model, the foundation of the data warehouse solution. Next we will use SSIS to combine data sources, cleanse data and ensure data integrity while loading the warehouse. After the data is loaded we will build an SSAS solution to provide users with drag and drop reporting functionality in Excel. Finally, we will talk about and demonstrate the different reporting options that are available. Whether you are new to BI, looking to expand your knowledge or just want to see how the world of data warehousing can provide value to your business, the Pragmatic Works BI Boot Camp has something for everyone.
