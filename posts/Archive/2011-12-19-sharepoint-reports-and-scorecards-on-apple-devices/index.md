![](https://images.bradleyschacht.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/AppleSharePoint.png) While some people may consider this topic off limits the fact remains that more and more companies are adopting Apple devices, namely the iPad, for use in their organizations. In the last quarterly earnings call from Apple they revealed that more than 80% of fortune 100 companies and more than 60% of fortune 500 companies are now using iOS devices in their organizations.  Regardless of the amount of implementation behind those numbers we are going to have to plan our reporting around the use of portables. In the latest SharePoint cumulative update for SharePoint 2010 support for report and scorecard viewing was added.  According to Microsoft this does require iOS 5 to work and of course there are limitations. Below are the highlights from the TechNet article.  The link is included so you can go grab the most current information direct from the source. After all, technology is constantly changing. **Note that Visio Services and PerformancePoint strategy maps are not supported.**
