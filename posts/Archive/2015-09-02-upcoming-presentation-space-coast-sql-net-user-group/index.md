If you happen to be in the central Florida or Daytona area head over to Melbourne on September 10th to see me! I'll be speaking at the newly merged Space Coast SQL/.Net User Group on Power Query. This topic is easy for anyone in SQL, business intelligence, .Net or even every day users to understand. I'll show you some awesome things you can do with Power Query and how to mash data together from many different sources. If that's not enough to get you to come out, then know this...they meet at Sonny's BBQ, so the food is going to be awesome and free!
