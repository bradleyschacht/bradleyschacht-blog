Have you ever wanted to browse your SharePoint 2010 site in Windows Explorer? If you are in SharePoint 2007 please upgrade to something a little more modern. In all seriousness, in SharePoint 2007 you could click on the Actions menu and then select **Open With Windows Explorer**. Simple. Easy. Fast forward to SharePoint 2010. The button is gone, but it's not **_really_** gone. There are many reasons why you may want to browse a SharePoint site in Windows Explorer.

- Drag and drop interface
- Multi-select
- Move multiple items quickly
- Navigate around complex sites quickly

Luckily the button may not be around in the same way it was before, but you still have very easy access to the same functionality. Just open up a document library and expand the ribbon at the top of the screen if it is hidden. Switch over to the **Library** tab and find the button on the right half of the screen that is labeled **Open With Explorer**. Here is what the button looks like when you have a little less room and the text is not visible:
