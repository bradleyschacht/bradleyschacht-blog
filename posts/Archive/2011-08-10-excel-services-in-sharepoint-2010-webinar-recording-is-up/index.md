First of all if you came out to my webinar this morning let me say a huge thank you!  I really appreciate everyone taking time out of their busy days to listen to me ramble on for about an hour this morning.  If you were there I hope you got some good information out of it. If you didn't get good information out of it you probably weren't paying attention... just kidding!!  :) My webinar today covered Excel Services in SharePoint 2010.  I covered the basics of setting up the web application and then showed how to create and deploy a workbook.  There were quite a few good questions that I unfortunately did not have time to get to.  Maybe I will do a follow up blog and post those here.  Who knows.  Anyway, here is the link to the recording.  You need an account with Pragmatic Works, but it is free to sign up and free to watch.  Enjoy and please let me know what feedback you have.  I have another webinar coming up in another month or so, but check the webinar page on PragmaticWorks.com for that. Recording Link: [http://pragmaticworks.com/Resources/webinars/WebinarSummary.aspx?ResourceID=326](https://pragmaticworks.com/) Don't forget every Tuesday and Thursday is the Pragmatic Works Free Training on the T's.  You can follow @PWFreeTraining on Twitter to keep up with all the webinars.
