Each week Pragmatic Works hosts a free training session. The topics include SQL Server internals, Business Intelligence, cloud services and even big data. On Tuesday May 2nd, 2017 I will be presenting the free training session on SQL Server 2016 security. Check out the details below. Hope to see you there. ![](https://images.bradleyschacht.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/pragmaticworks_free_training_01.png) **Topic:** End-to-End Security with SQL Server 2016 **Abstract:** It only takes one data breach to lose trust and credibility with your customers. While previous versions of SQL Server have been very secure, SQL Server 2016 has added some major security features. From built-in row-level security to dynamic data masking to ensuring data is always encrypted at rest, in flight and in the application, this is the most secure release of SQL Server ever! In this session, you will learn how to leverage these new features independently for specific-use cases or working together for solid end-to-end security. The best part of all these features is that they require minimal or no downstream application changes! **Registration link:** [http://pragmaticworks.com/Training/Details/End-to-End-Security-with-SQL-Server-2016](http://pragmaticworks.com/Training/Details/End-to-End-Security-with-SQL-Server-2016)
