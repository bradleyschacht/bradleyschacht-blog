Thank you to everyone who attended my free webinar hosted by Pragmatic Works yesterday (September 20, 2011) on SSIS Variables and Expressions.  The webinar was recorded, so if you want to reference it again or if you were unable to attend and wanted to see it you can view the recording from this link [here](https://pragmaticworks.com/) the clicking view on the right side on the Pragmatic Works website (Here is the [direct link](https://pragmaticworks.com/) to the view button). I will be answering questions today if I was unable to get to your question in the webinar.  I may even do a blog post with some of the questions and answers for everyone to be able to see them.  I mentioned some new blog content based around variables and expressions that I will be doing in the near future, so be on the look out for that if you want some practice applying the concepts from the recording. I have another webinar where I will be doing an overview of ETL next month that you should also attend if you are new to the world of ETL.  It will be focused on SSIS since the Microsoft BI stack is our target audience.  :)  Hope to see you there!  Note that I am scheduled to be with a client that morning, so I may be having to move that back a week.  Stay tuned for updates though.
