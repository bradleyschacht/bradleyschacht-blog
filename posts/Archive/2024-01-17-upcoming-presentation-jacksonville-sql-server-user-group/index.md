I’m excited to announce that I will be speaking at the February meeting of the [Jacksonville SQL Server User](https://www.meetup.com/jaxssug/) Group (JSSUG). It’s always fun to spend some time with local SQL community. I’ll be presenting a session recapping all the exciting features added to [Microsoft Fabric](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-fabric) in 2023 and previewing what's ahead for 2024.

### Microsoft Fabric 2023 Year in Review and 2024 Roadmap

Less than one year ago Microsoft Fabric was announced at the Build 2023 conference. Since then the team has been hard at work rolling out new features and functionality each month. From small improvements like the ability to convert entire folders to Delta with a right-click rather than going file by file or background improvements like faster CSV loading to marquee functionality like the launch of multiple Copilots and the announcement of general availability or the new database mirroring, 2023 was a huge year for Fabric. We will run down the list of some of the biggest announcements and show demos along the way so you can see the exciting functionality that is being delivered each and every month. Then, we will take a look at the year ahead with a sneak peak into the 2024 roadmap. If you're using Fabric or considering using Fabric for a project, you'll want to join this session to see what all the buzz is about!
