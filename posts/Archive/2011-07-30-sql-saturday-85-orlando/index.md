![](https://images.bradleyschacht.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/SQLSaturday85.png)SQL Saturday #85 is quickly approaching. It will be held in sunny Orlando, FL so if you live in the area get ready for awesome because I am coming to town! Ok, that may have been a little over the top but all parts of that thought are in fact true. I am coming to town for the event and it will be awesome.

To start with if you are a SQL Server professional in any way you should come out for the day. That includes all the DBAs, .Net developers that work with SQL and of course the BI developers out there. There is going to be something for everyone. Even better if you are wanting to find a quick and easy way to get up to speed on the entire BI stack or want to see how to develop and end to end data warehouse solution then Friday is really going to be a great day of training. This year a few of the guys from Pragmatic Works have been given the opportunity to teach a full day pre-con on Friday that is all about business intelligence. The day will feature myself, Jorge Segarra ([blog](http://sqlchicken.com "SQL Chicken") | [Twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/sqlchicken)), Mike Davis (Blog | [Twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/mikedavissql)) and Kyle Walker (Blog). We are all BI developers at Pragmatic Works in Jacksonville, FL. There is a price to attend the pre-con but I think that what we have planed for the day will be more than made up in value. The day will start with data modeling and how to design a data warehouse, then discuss how to load it with SSIS, build a cube in SSAS and finish with a presentation layer in SSRS, Excel and PowerPivot. If any of those topics interest you or may be needed in an upcoming project it will be a great learning experience. We will get you some hands on experience and you are more than welcome to bring your laptop and follow along on your own. There will be plenty of opportunity to ask questions as well, so bring those with you as well! More details will be at the bottom of the blog. In addition to the pre-con each of the four of us are presenting Saturday for the free SQL Saturday event. I will be presenting two sessions. The first will be the very first session of the day at 9 am and will be an introduction to SSIS. We will talk about how to get past the learning curve of SSIS and take you through the basics of building your first package. The second session will be a little later at 1:30 when we will talk about making SSIS more dynamic with expressions, variables and configurations. I get bored watching sessions with nothing but slides so I promise not to do that. These will be all demo all the time, well mostly I have to give myself a cheesy intro via PowerPoint otherwise it wouldn’t be a technical session now would it. We will have some fun in both sessions and there may even be prizes to give away to people! If you aren’t busy Saturday the 24th of September be sure to come out. What do you have to loose; it’s free and you get to meet me. Saturday Complete! If you do have a little bit of a training budget and can swing it come out for the full day on Friday as well.
