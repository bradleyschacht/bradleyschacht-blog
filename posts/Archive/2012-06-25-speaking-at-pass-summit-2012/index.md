It's about that time again, [PASS Summit 2012](http://www.sqlpass.org/summit/2012/) is right around the corner in Seattle, WA. It will be held at the convention center from November 6-9. This year will feature more than 170 sessions across 6 tracks from 90 speakers in addition to 2 days of pre-cons; and that doesn't even include the sessions from Microsoft! I have spoken at a lot of SQL Saturdays, code camps and done a handful of webinars for Pragmatic Works over the last couple of years and decided to take a shot and submit a session or two for Summit. Of the four sessions I submitted I had two accepted! I'm very excited to have this opportunity to go and speak at such a great event. I've heard so many wonderful things about Summit over the past few years and now I get to be a part of it for the first time. If you are interested in SharePoint BI at all then the two sessions I am doing are for you. Check them out below: **PowerPivot 101:** Building an SSAS cube isn't for everyone. PowerPivot is! This session is for anyone who wants to get started in PowerPivot. Join us as we build a PowerPivot model from the ground up and then create some reports, all in just over an hour. Learn how to use data from existing sources, such as SQL Server databases or Analysis Services, as well as how to integrate currently unrelated data from sources such as Excel workbooks and the Azure data market to bring new life to your data – like analyzing sales based on weather conditions. **SharePoint for Business Intelligence:** Are you aware of the many features SharePoint has to offer the Business Intelligence world? In this session, you'll get an overview of SharePoint 2010 and how to integrate it with your current or new BI infrastructure. We'll discuss the general use of SharePoint for BI and basic setup and installation of the farm, then fly over a completed SharePoint site. You'll tour SharePoint Central Administration, learning how to allow your site to take advantage of many BI features such as PowerPivot, Excel Services, and Reporting Services. With the release of SQL Server 2012, you'll also get a sneak peak at some improvements available in SharePoint for those who want to be on the cutting edge of this growing technology. Forget the slides – this tour will be all demo! If you have ever seen me present you will know one thing: I'm not a big fan of slides. Both of these sessions will be demo heavy so you can get a close look at what is really going on with the technology. There are a lot of great sessions out there from some new names like myself and some much more well known names as well. Head over to the [Conference Sessions](http://www.sqlpass.org/summit/2012/Sessions/ConferenceSessions.aspx) page and check out the list of sessions! If you haven't registered yet head over to the [Summit](http://www.sqlpass.org/summit/2012/) home page and get on it. The price goes up after June 30th. Are you going to PASS Summit this year? If so, I hope to see you there!
