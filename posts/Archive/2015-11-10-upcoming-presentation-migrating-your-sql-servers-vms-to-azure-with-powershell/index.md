The topics include SQL Server internals, Business Intelligence, cloud services and even big data. On Tuesday November 17th, 2015 I will be presenting the free training session on Azure Virtual Machines. Devin Knight ([Twitter](http://twitter.com/knight_devin) | [Blog](http://devinknightsql.com)) and I presented on this topic recently and it received a great response. Whether you are already using Azure Virtual Machines or just want to hear some information about the benefits and the process of moving your infrastructure to Azure, this session is for you.

Many companies are taking their server infrastructure to the cloud, with great success. But how are they migrating their existing environments? In this session, you learn not only how to create your own virtual environment in Azure, but also how to migrate your existing servers to the cloud by using PowerShell. Using PowerShell with Azure’s Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) gives you the ability to quickly scale and build new servers with a few simple scripts.
